        <h1>About Our Initiative</h1>
        <p>We all know that a lot of food gets wasted at functions and events. We are here to buy food from function halls that is going to waste for a nominal cost. Later, we will sell this food on the street for a very low price. Since it's function food, it is obviously of good taste and would otherwise go to waste, so they will charge us very little. We plan to sell it on the streets and in special types of hotels.</p>
